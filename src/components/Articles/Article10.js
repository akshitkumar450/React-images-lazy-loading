                    Online learning has many advantages but also a few
                    accompanying disadvantages such as inhibition of
                    relationship formation and self-development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imagine a class of students, where each student is being
                    taught the same course material but separately, at their own
                    personal desks. After the lesson is taught, the teacher
                    gives them a quiz to check their comprehension and then
                    everyone goes about their day. The students don’t have
                    another incentive to interact with the course material, the
                    teacher has no way of understanding what adjustments need to
                    be made to customise the material in a way that’s favourable
                    to everybody.
                </p>
                <p className='py-4'>
                    Such a learning environment can prove to be very
                    ineffective, and to overcome this it is wise to take help of
                    collaboration software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Collaboration software helps in adding a human touch in
                    digital learning programs by providing features that enable
                    productive communication and collaboration between all the
                    members of a community. While it enables students to learn
                    with and from-one another, it also proves useful to teachers
                    as it helps them to get vital feedback, adapt and improve
                    their courses. To learn about the advantages that
